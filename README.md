Based on my tutorial here: https://medium.com/@JonDeng/a-contrarian-guide-to-getting-into-hack-reactor-a2ee07c8a3a8#.64519vd3f

Two problems with two solutions.

If you have git the easy way to do this is to type below in your terminal (without the '$''):

`$ git clone https://github.com/dengjonathan/HR_tutorial`

`$ cd HR_tutorial`

Then open and play around in your editor of choice.
